This is an attempt at my own personal project for a game idea I have in my head. I have assets and such picked out from others who can work blender, this is still something I need to start learning in the near future to make my own assets. My idea here is a SciFi style doom-like game. My first and most important goal is to make an FPS that will run well and all the basic machanics are fine, then from there I will let my ideas flow into the project and maybe one day this will be a competent and complete game. Wish me luck as I have a strange feeling this will not be so easy.
